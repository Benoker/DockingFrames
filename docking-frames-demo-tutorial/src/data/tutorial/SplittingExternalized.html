Usually externalized CDockables can be stacked, but there is no way to split them on the same window.

With help of a <i>ExternalizingCGridAreaConfiguration</i> we can change this behavior.

<b>Note:</b> Many people asked for such a feature, but it does make the user interface hard to use. It is not
recommended to use this feature except for hard-core power users.
