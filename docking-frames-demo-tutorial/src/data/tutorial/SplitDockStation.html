<html><body>This example shows three ways to set up the layout on a SplitDockStation.

<ul>
	<li>Sequential: by adding one Dockable after another to the station.</li>
	<li>SplitDockTree: by building the internal datastructure of the station manually.</li>
	<li>SplitDockGrid: by using a helper class for which we only need to specify how the layout
	should look in the end. </li>
</ul>
