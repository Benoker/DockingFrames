The <b>Common API</b> builds upon the Core API. It combines and configures features from the Core API, such that applications
can easily use them.<br><br>
The strength of the Common API are its default settings, and that it is hiding the really complex things from the developer.
<br><br>
<b>If you want to just write an application, then the Common API is for you. If you want to implement additional features,
then you need to study the Core API as well.</b>
