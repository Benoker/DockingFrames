A common task is to open yet another CDockable. When opening a CDockable we want that dockable to show up close to the 
currently focused dockable. CDockable offers several methods to do that, all have a name like "CDockable.setLocationsAside...".

If opening CDockables on a CWorkingArea we can also make use of the "show" method, which not only sets the location,
but also registers the Dockable at the CControl. </body></html>
