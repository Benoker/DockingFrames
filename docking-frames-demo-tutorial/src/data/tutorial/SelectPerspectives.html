"Perspective" and "layout" are two words for the same thing: the information how CDockables are placed on CStations.<br><br>

The "Perspective API" is an easy way for clients to build layouts without needing access to the actual CDockables. This
example shows how the perspectives can be applied to an application:
<ul>
	<li>The first, and preferred, method is to first create several perspectives, and then call "save" and "load" to switch between the layouts.</li>
	<li>The second, not so good, approach is to create perspectives and apply them when the users calls for it.</li>
</ul>

The first approach has the added bonus, that changes made by the user can be saved. It can further be combined with the
"write" and "read" method of CControl, to persistently store the settings made by the user.
