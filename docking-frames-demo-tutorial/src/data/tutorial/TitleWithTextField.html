Dockables can have actions (buttons, checkboxes, ...), but what if you want a new type of action? For example 
a textfield? This example shows:
<ul>
	<li>That every action consists of a model (a DockAction)</li>
	<li>... and a wrapper offering a nice API (a CAction)</li>
	<li>... and a view that actually shows content (a JComponent)</li>
	<li>... and how all of these elements need to be combined.</li>
</ul>
