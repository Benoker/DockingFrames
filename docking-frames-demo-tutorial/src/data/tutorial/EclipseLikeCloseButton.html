If the look of the close button in the EclipseTheme is not satisfying, clients can customize the look and behavior a bit
more. This example shows how to:
<ul>
	<li>Change the icons of the close button</li>
	<li>Remove the borders around the button</li>
	<li>Hide the button if it is on an unselected tab</li>
</ul>
