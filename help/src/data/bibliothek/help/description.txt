This client shows a set of pages, created by JavaDoc.<br>
Some noteworthy features:
<ul>
	<li>The posibility to show and hide panels, is implemented in the DockFrontend.
	Exactly one line per panel is needed to activate the feature.</li>
	<li>The posibility to store and load the location and size of all panels, is
	also implemented in the DockFrontend.</li>
	<li>Minimizing/Normalizing a panel is not part of DockingFrames. This
	functionality was newly written, and needs about 200 lines of code.</li>
	<li>The drop-down-menus are part of DockingFrames. They consist of a list
	of actions, and they can copy the icons/tooltip/behavior of the last
	selected action.</li>
	<li>The buttons on the top are not part of DockingFrames. They are just
	JPanels which paint an icon for an associated Dockable and have a MouseListener
	which shows the associated Dockable when clicked. But they are registered
	as DockElementRepresentative and thus inherit some abilities a Dockable has.
	For example: if dragged, then instead of the button the associated Dockable
	gets dragged.</li>
</ul>
