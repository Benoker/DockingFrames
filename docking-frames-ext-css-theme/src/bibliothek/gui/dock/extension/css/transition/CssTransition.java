/**
 * A {@link CssTransition} describes the transition between one {@link CssRule} to another {@link CssRule}. The transition
 * may include features like colors softly blending over to a new style, or shapes slowly changing their outline.<br>
 * The lifecycle of any {@link CssTransition} looks always like this:
 * <ol>
 * 	<li>Upon applying a new {@link CssRule} the {@link CssTransition} is created from a factory.</li>
 *  <li>Immediatelly afterwards {@link #init(CssRule, CssTransitionCallback) init} is called, the transition is now
 *  allowed to change properties whenever it wants.</li>
 *  <li>If another {@link CssRule} is applied, {@link #transition(CssRule) transition} is called. The transition should
 *  now slowy apply the new rule. As there may already be an transition active on the new rule, this transition
 *  may actually gain access to a wrapper which behaves like an animated {@link CssRule}.</li>
 *  <li>At the end of its lifetime the transition should call {@link CssTransitionCallback#destroyed()} to inform
 *  the framework that this transition will never be used again.</li>
 * </ol>
 * The transition can and should make use of the {@link CssTransitionCallback} to learn:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>Which properties can be animated</li>
 *  <li>Override properties with new values</li>
 *  <li>Ask for delayed execution of {@link #step()}</li>
 *  <li>Inform the framework that it is no longer active</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * If transitions are handled by the {@link DefaultAnimatedCssRuleChain}, some limitations are applied: transitions of 
 * one {@link CssRule} run in parallel, they do not know of each other nor can they influence each other. It is not
 * possible to use the output of one transition as input for another transition. If two transitions modify the same 
 * property, then one of the transitions is silently ignored. If a customized {@link TransitionalCssRuleChain} is in use,
 * these limitations may no longer apply.
