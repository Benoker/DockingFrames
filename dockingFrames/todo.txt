- [Done] EclipseTheme: tab selection if tabs overlap
- [Done] EclipseTheme: Border replaceable (perhaps together with the TabPainter?)
- [Done] Double click on DockTitle or Dockable, use global mechanism instead of the SplitDockStation-mechanism
- ScreenDockStation: truly support multiple screens. Check location of dialog only after mouse has been released
- [Done] Commons: new layer that simplifies DF. Should not contain more than 5 public interfaces
- [Done] A global way to use the keyboard to give additional commands when moving a Dockable
- All DockStations: make sure the children do not get too small, for example use "getPreferredSize" or a similar mechanism.
- [Done] ShapedGradientPainter & others: exchangeable colors
- [Done] Store and load DockSituation from XML?
- [Done] Allow StackDockStations to have different colors on the tab.
- [Done] Possibility to fix size of Dockables on SplitDockStations
- [Done] Guide: mention ColorSchemes and the new layout capabilities of SplitDockStation
- SplitDockStation: droping children with SplitDockProperty does not work when the stations size is too small (or the station is not child of a frame?)
- [Done] Problems with LaF jtatto, decorated windows
- [Done] Problem with Nimbus, colors not found
- [Done] Actions (minimize, ...) of CDockable should be customizeable and hideable
- [Done] More flexibility in different stations for common, for example only one minimizing-area
- Size request on invisible panels?
- ButtonPanel: handling add/remove actions and how many actions should be on the menu, is not yet very save and needs too much resources
- When a StackDockStation is visible: changing from EclipseTheme to BubbleTheme will leave some Dockable-Components invisible (tested with "Paint").
- DockController.putRepresentative: should also work for DoubleClickListeners and the Relocator
- Support for tooltips on titles and tabs?
