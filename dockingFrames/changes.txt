- Bugfix: SplitDockStation's compare-method now ensures that the station does not overlap other, smaller stations
- Layout: New "Eclipse Theme", written by Janni Kovacs

- Layout: StackDockStation tries to paint the insertion-line now between its tabs
- API: ScreenDockDialog should always stay in the screen in which it has been created, this feature is not tested

[Release 1.0 - v1.0.2]

- Layout: double click on shaped- or rect-tabs in EclipseTheme has now the same effects a double click on a title.
- Bugfix: DockHierarchyEvents were not properly dispatched by the SplitDockStation
- Bugfix: ShapedGradientPainter did not recognize MouseEvents properly
- Layout, API: the TabPainter of the EclipseTheme now determines the border of some components

- API: KeyEvents are caught by the KeyBoardController. Some DockActions can now be triggered by a KeyEvent.
- API: DockAction has additional method "trigger" which results in the execution of a default-action.
- API: all create*-methods of DockController moved into a new interface DockControllerFactory
- API: new DockRelocatorMode, changes behaviour of drag&drop operations subject to the pressed keys on the keyboard.
- API: DockController can tell which Component is child (in the logic of the dock-tree) of which Dockable. Scheme can be influenced by clients through DockController#putRepresentative.
- Layout, API: DockStations have to decide whether a child can be accepted or not, the DockRelocator no longer does this. That gives more flexibility.
- API: MovingTitleGetter replaced by DockableMovingImageFactory, gives more flexibility
- Layout: FlatTheme now shows a screencapture of the Dockable that is moved by the user instead of the DockTitle
- Bugfix: The method "drop" on many DockStations did not ensure that the tree gets no cycles
- Bugfix: MultiDockActionSource added the wrong listener to its children, the effect was that some updates were lost
- Bugfix: SplitDockStation: full-screen elements not properly removed on drag-operation.
- API: new SplitDockPathProperty, allows to store the location of a child of a SplitDockStation. Replaces SplitDockProperty whenever possible, but the SplitDockProperty remains a valid way to describe the boundaries of a Dockable.
- Bugfix: DockUtilities.isAnchestor failed when the ancestor was a ScreenDockStation
- Bugfix: Memoryleak in ButtonPanel
- Bugfix: ButtonPanel did not show all visualisations if a DockAction occurred more than once in the DockActionSource

- Bugfix: FlapDockStationFactory did not read layout correctly when Dockables were missing
- API: Many factories divided in two parts. Part 1 is the factory, part 2 is the "layout". A layout is snapshot of some data. Factories can read and write layouts from/to streams and xml files. Factories can convert layouts into the original data.

- API: CDockables have a ColorMap that is used to change the color of tabs and titles
- API: Common uses its own set of DockThemes
- Bugfix: EclipseTheme Shaped/RectGradientPaint did not do "doLayout" correct, the effect was that some buttons got too small
- API: LookAndFeel changes noted by DockController and forwarded to all UIListeners

[v1.0.4]
- Bugfix: BubbleDisplayer did not calculate its "getDockableInsets" correctly. A flaw in the design of BasicDockableDisplayer caused the failure.
! API: almost everyone that uses a Input/OutputStream now writes the version number into the stream. This will help to implement backwards compatibility. This should be the last break in the file format.
! API: DockableListener has an additional method "titleExchanged" which can be used to exchange a DockTitle.
! API: CDockable and subclasses can now hide or show their titles at any time.
- Layout: BubbleDisplayer now shows a border if the title is not null, or if the dockable is not a station

- API: DockFrontend supports "empty dockables". That means that DockFrontend can store properties for Dockables which are not registered at the frontend
- Bugfix: Unbind was called to often on some DockActions when they were children of a Menu-Action

[v1.0.5]
- Layout: Changed the default KeyStroke to close a CDockable/hide a Dockable from ctrl+c to ctrl+F4, Andrew pointed out that ctrl+c already has a special meaning...
- API: new listeners (CFocusListener, CKeyboardListener, CDoubleClickListener, global KeyListener) which can be added to CDockable (local information) or directly to CControl (global information)

- API: the DockableSelector/DockableSelection allow users to select new Dockables with the keyboard
- API: DockController can find the root-window of an application, the window can also be set directly using "setRootWindow".
! API: DockTheme has an additional method getDockableSelection 
- API: the ComponentHierarchyObserver includes now DockTitles in its search for Components
- Bugfix: when using LookAndFeels that could draw window decarations on their own (like JTattoo), then FlapWindow, ScreenDockDialog and others could have decorations. Their JRootPane is now explicitly advised not to have any decorations.
- API: some LookAndFeels use their own scheme how to name colors. With LookAndFeelColors it is now possible to use a specialized algorithm for different LookAndFeels to extract their colors.
- Bugfix: BasicTheme did not update colors for key paint.line, paint.divider and paint.division. Hence the color used to indicate drag and drop elements was black on most systems.
- Bugfix, Layout: The bounds of children of SplitDockStation are now always within the station, rounding errors are cut away.
- Layout: EclipseTheme uses more colors directly from the LookAndFeel.
! API: TabPainter does no longer paint the strip, it now creates an object that paints the strip. That object can now work with the color-map. 
- Bugfix: Focus system could throw a NPE. 
- Layout: colors of the Nimbus LookAndFeel can be extracted under jdk 1.6.0_10

- Bugfix: Chessdemo did not correctly calculate the "en passent" maneuver
- API: KeyboardController does no longer fire events when the source of the event could not be found, hence the KeyboardListener does no longer receive null as source.
- API: KeyboardController supports now "global KeyListeners". This listeners get informed about any event that the KeyboardController handles, even if there is no DockElement as source of the event.
- API: clients can now add and remove Components from the ComponentHiearchyObserver, DockController will add the root-window to the observer if it knows the root window.
- Bugfix: when focusing a normalized CDockable that was hidden by a maximized element, then the focused Dockable did not replace the maximized element.
- Bugfix: when changing the ExtendedMode of a CDockable, directly or indirectly, then state-events could be lost.
! API: DockableFocusListener/ComponentHierarchyObserverListener now use events
! API: DockableFocusAdapter deleted, no longer necessary

! API, Layout: Dockables can now have a tooltip, this tooltip is shown on titles and tabs. (!: Dockable.getTitleToolTip, DockableListener.titleToolTipChanged).
- API: New UIProperties, a generalisation of ColorManager
! API: ColorManager extends UIProperties, ColorProbider replaced by ColorBridge which extends UIBridge, DockColor extends UIValue.
- API, Layout: The ConflictResolver in common can now be used to resolve conflicts on resize when locked CDockables are around. Can be applied using the key CControl.RESIZE_LOCK_CONFLICT_RESOLVER
- API: New ConflictResolver "FullLockConflictResolver" inspired by the behavior of VLDocking
- Bugfix: DefaultConflictResolver creates now better combinations of ResizeRequests if the combined requests have different priority
! API: The size request is now handled with RequestDimension and no longer with Dimension. This allows to issue requests only for one of width or height, and to lock only one of width or height
- API: new interface DockElementRepresentative which creates a link between a Component and a DockElement. Allows a unified way to make popup menus, drag and drop Dockables and more
! API: Dockable and DockTitle now also implement DockElementRepresentative
- Bugfix: when opening a CDockable that would stack on another CDockable which was maximized, the layout could get scrambled.
- Layout: Closing a maximized CDockable will not normalize other maximized Dockables
- API, Layout: Clicking on the "close-action" in common and calling "setVisible( false )" will now have the exact same effects.
- API: new preferences package, includes new MenuPieces
! API: SimpleModifierMask has been deleted, it gets replaced by ModiferMask which is no longer an interface. Reason is that a modifier mask does not need to be very sophisticated and chances of additional implementions are hardly given. Also the preferences can now operate with the modifier masks.
- API: BasicTheme and subclasses read their ColorScheme from the Properties using a PropertyKey
- API: AbstractCDockable can have default-locations, the default locations are set using the new method CStateManager#setLocation(Dockable, ExtendedMode, CLocation)
- Layout: OverpaintablePanel now supports Borders
- Bugfix: Dockables can now be dropped onto SplitDockStation using some position information even if the station has a size of 0/0.
- Bugfix: CSplitLocation.expandProperty did process the first element of a tree-path twice.
- Bugfix: CStateManager.getLocation did return null when it should produce a result. 
- Bugfix: There were also some CLocations which did not return the correct result causing getLocation to fail. 
- API: CControl uses now a ThemeMap to select its DockTheme. The method "setTheme( DockTheme )" has been marked as deprecated and is replaced by "setTheme( String )".
! API: the DockTheme of a CControl is no longer stored by the CThemeMenuPiece but directly by its ThemeMap. 
! API: ThemeMenuPiece rewritten in order to use and support ThemeMap. ThemeMenuPiece does no longer contain a list of ThemeFactories.
- Bugfix: Moving away from EclipseTheme could left some Dockables invisible
- Bugfix: updateColors in varios DockThemes could throw NPE (found by Parag Shah)
- Bugfix: JCheckBoxMenuItem and JRadioButtonMenuItem did not work in popup-menu
- API: new method "createRoot" in SplitDockStation, allows clients to use their own roots.
- API: new method "setResizingEnabled" in SplitDockStation

! API: MultiColorProviderFactory renamed to MultiColorBridgeFactory

[v1.0.7]
! API: Each Dockable can now configure a DockableDisplayerHints which is used by the parent of the Dockable. The hints tell the parent how to draw elements around the Dockable. Dockables must implement the new method configureDisplayerHints.
- API: new AdjacentDockFactory, something like a DockFactory that can store additional information about a Dockable.
- Layout: The button-title on FlapDockStation can be colorized as well, new keys for ColorMap in Common
- API: CControl can now be created without a JFrame
- API: new WindowProvider allows to later set the root-window of CControl, DockFrontend, DockController or ScreenDockStation. Also allows to change the root window.
- Bugfix: SplitDockStation: a Dockable could be dropped over another dockable which did not accept the combination
! API: new ScreenDockWindowFactory: creates the windows for ScreenDockStation. ScreenDockDialog inherits from a new class.
- API: FlapDockProperty stores now also holding state and window size
! API: DockFactory now uses DockableLayoutInfo instead of Dockable when setting up a layout
- API: DockSituation has new methods "estimateLocation" to estimate the DockableProperty of Dockables even if they or their parents are not yet created
- API: DockSituation has a new method "fillMissing" to convert byte[]- or xml-data to DockLayout even after the DockLayoutComposition was already read
- API: DockFrontend#setSetting now tries to fill missing gaps in the layout before applying it.
- Bugfix: Dropping a CGrid with 3 or more stacked elements produced an exception
- API: DockFrontend stores also the layout of invisible elements (using DockFactories)
- Bugfix: DockFrontend.read from DataInputStream did mark the main Setting as "entry=true" while it should have been "entry=false"
