[Beta v1.0.1]
- Bugfix: popup menu of a DockTitle did not open on right click under Windows XP
- Bugfix: Connection between DockableDisplayer and Dockable was not broken automatically (memory leak)
- Bugfix: Connection between MultiDockActionSource and its children was not broken automatically (memory leak)
- Bugfix: FullScreenListener was not removed from Map (memory leak)
- API: StackDockStation now reads a StackDockComponentFactory out of the DockProperties, and changes its StackDockComponent according to the factory. DockThemes no longer have to exchange the components manually.
- Layout: Left-click on AbstractDockTitle will open a popup menu more often
- Bugfix: SplitDockStation did not properly remove the front-dockable when requested
- Layout: FlapDockStation now changes the selected child when the mouse is released, not when the mouse is pressed.
- Layout: The DockTitles shown as Buttons for FlapDockStation have additional behavior when the mouse is pressed.
- Bugfix: added some dirty hacks to ensure that the title-drag-window will close itself when the first event was ignored. That happend when the Window was not visible when dispose was called.
- Bugfix: PopupController did not calculate the correct position of the mouse
- Bugfix: AbstractDockTitle did not calculate the correct position and size of its icon when explicitly asked
- Bugfix: NPE thrown by SecureFlapWindow when closing the window a second time
- API: delete some subclasses of Combiner which are no longer needed (Bubble/FlatCombiner)
- Layout: BasicStationPaint now uses the highlight-background color of TextField to paint. That should look better with different look and feels.
- Bugfix: SplitDockStation's compare-method now ensures that the station does not overlap other, smaller stations
- Layout: New "Eclipse Theme", written by Janni Kovacs
- API: DockableDisplayer now tells whether a point lies inside its title or not. The drag n drop gets more flexibel this way
- Bugfix: SecureScreenDockDialog throws NPE when closing
- API: DockActionSource has now to implement Iterable<DockAction>
- API: New DockActionSource "FilteredDockActionSource"
- Bugfix: EclipseStackDockComponent now shows all DockActions
- API: New DockHierarchyListener gets informed when the path to a Dockable changes
- API: New HierarchyDockActionSource, lists all actions of a Dockable even when the hierarchy changes
- API: No rebind of DockTitles after a drag&drop event, the DockHierarchyListener can be used by the titles which need change
- API: Dockable now offers a "local" and a "global" DockActionSource. The global source always contains all available actions
- Layout, API: MenuableButtonPanel, allows to use menus when there is no space for buttons. Automatically used by AbstractDockTitle
- API: DockableDisplayer is now an interface
- API, Bugfix: replaced every occurence of "binded" by "bound", thanks Uwe for correcting me
- API: When adding a Dockable to a DockStation, the station will ensure that no cycles are built into the dock-tree, and that the Dockable is properly removed from its former parent
- Layout: StackDockStation tries to paint the insertion-line now between its tabs
- API: ScreenDockDialog should always stay in the screen in which it has been created, this feature is not tested

[Release 1.0 - v1.0.2]
- API: new DoubleClickController, allows handling double clicks on a global scale. Makes the FullScreenClickableListener obsolete.
- Layout: double click on shaped- or rect-tabs in EclipseTheme has now the same effects a double click on a title.
- Bugfix: DockHierarchyEvents were not properly dispatched by the SplitDockStation
- Bugfix: ShapedGradientPainter did not recognize MouseEvents properly
- Layout, API: the TabPainter of the EclipseTheme now determines the border of some components
- Bugfix: Some DockHierarchyEvents were lost
- API: KeyEvents are caught by the KeyBoardController. Some DockActions can now be triggered by a KeyEvent.
- API: DockAction has additional method "trigger" which results in the execution of a default-action.
- API: all create*-methods of DockController moved into a new interface DockControllerFactory
- API: new DockRelocatorMode, changes behaviour of drag&drop operations subject to the pressed keys on the keyboard.
- API: DockController can tell which Component is child (in the logic of the dock-tree) of which Dockable. Scheme can be influenced by clients through DockController#putRepresentative.
- Layout, API: DockStations have to decide whether a child can be accepted or not, the DockRelocator no longer does this. That gives more flexibility.
- API: MovingTitleGetter replaced by DockableMovingImageFactory, gives more flexibility
- Layout: FlatTheme now shows a screencapture of the Dockable that is moved by the user instead of the DockTitle
- Bugfix: The method "drop" on many DockStations did not ensure that the tree gets no cycles
- Bugfix: MultiDockActionSource added the wrong listener to its children, the effect was that some updates were lost
- Bugfix: SplitDockStation: full-screen elements not properly removed on drag-operation.
- API: new SplitDockPathProperty, allows to store the location of a child of a SplitDockStation. Replaces SplitDockProperty whenever possible, but the SplitDockProperty remains a valid way to describe the boundaries of a Dockable.
- Bugfix: DockUtilities.isAnchestor failed when the ancestor was a ScreenDockStation
- Bugfix: Memoryleak in ButtonPanel
- Bugfix: ButtonPanel did not show all visualisations if a DockAction occurred more than once in the DockActionSource
- Bugfix: MenuMenuHandler could create a memoryleak by not properly unbinding the visualization of a DockAction
- API: ComponentHierarchyObserver collects all Components which are used in the realm of a specific DockController
- Bugfix: empty SplitDockStation could throw NullPointerException during drag&drop operation
- API: removed the necessity to create GlassedPane's in a restricted environment manually
- API: extensive reorganisation of packages in order to let the important classes/interfaces be in the top-level packages
! API: OverpaintablePanel, using a "base" and a "content"-pane, calls to "setContentPane" now have to be replaced by "setBasePane"
- Bugfix: ScreencaupterMovingImageFactory could throw IllegalArgumentException, thanks Peter for finding that bug
- Bugfix: DockController.ensureFocusSet could throw NPE
- API, Bugfix: AbstractDockable, changing the "action-offers" through "setActionOffers" will immediately be visible anywhere.
- Bugfix: DockFrontend.clean could be stuck in an infinite loop
- API: DockFrontendListener.showed renamed to shown
- API: DockFrontendListener.shown/hidden is now called for every Dockable, even if the Dockable was not shown or hidden through the methods of DockFrontend.
- API: The SingleParentRemover of DockController can now be exchanged, the property "singleParentRemove" has been deleted: if a remover is present, it is used. Otherwise the feature is disabled.
- API: DockControllerListener replaced by several smaller listeners that handle only one kind of events.
- API: New property ScreenDockStation.BOUNDARY_RESTRICTION: allows to put restrictions on size and location of children of a ScreenDockStation.
- Bugfix: FlapDockStationFactory did not read layout correctly when Dockables were missing
- API: Many factories divided in two parts. Part 1 is the factory, part 2 is the "layout". A layout is snapshot of some data. Factories can read and write layouts from/to streams and xml files. Factories can convert layouts into the original data.
- API: Support for xml, intended for debugging purposes.
- Bugfix: SplitDockStation fired dockableAdding/Added-Event to often.

- Bugfix: Several bugs in the Common project concerning the transition of modes of children of CWorkingAreas.
- Bugfix: SingleParentRemover removed DockStations when DockUI updated DockTheme
- API: The tree of a SplitDockStation is now accessible and modifiable from outside

- API: LookAndFeel changes noted by DockController and forwarded to all UIListeners
- Bugfix: Memoryleak in FlatTab and BubbleStackDockComponent
- Bugfix: StateManager did not store the old location of a Dockable that was maximized, but not registered, when working with XML files

[v1.0.4]
- Bugfix: BubbleDisplayer did not calculate its "getDockableInsets" correctly. A flaw in the design of BasicDockableDisplayer caused the failure.
! API: almost everyone that uses a Input/OutputStream now writes the version number into the stream. This will help to implement backwards compatibility. This should be the last break in the file format.
! API: DockableListener has an additional method "titleExchanged" which can be used to exchange a DockTitle.
! API: CDockable and subclasses can now hide or show their titles at any time.
- Layout: BubbleDisplayer now shows a border if the title is not null, or if the dockable is not a station
