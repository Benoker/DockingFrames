- Bugfix: Connection between MultiDockActionSource and its children was not broken automatically (memory leak)
- Bugfix: FullScreenListener was not removed from Map (memory leak)

- Layout: The DockTitles shown as Buttons for FlapDockStation have additional behavior when the mouse is pressed.
- Bugfix: added some dirty hacks to ensure that the title-drag-window will close itself when the first event was ignored. That happend when the Window was not visible when dispose was called.

- Bugfix: NPE thrown by SecureFlapWindow when closing the window a second time
- API: delete some subclasses of Combiner which are no longer needed (Bubble/FlatCombiner)

- Bugfix: SplitDockStation's compare-method now ensures that the station does not overlap other, smaller stations
- Layout: New "Eclipse Theme", written by Janni Kovacs

- API: New HierarchyDockActionSource, lists all actions of a Dockable even when the hierarchy changes
- API: No rebind of DockTitles after a drag&drop event, the DockHierarchyListener can be used by the titles which need change
- API: Dockable now offers a "local" and a "global" DockActionSource. The global source always contains all available actions
