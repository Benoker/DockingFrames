<html><body>The Toolbar extension adds toolbars to the framework. Toolbars work like any other CDockable, the extensions
does however change the configuration of the framework such that the toolbars cannot be mixed with normal CDockables.<br>
To use the extension, clients only have to include the JAR files of the extension in their classpath. The framework will
automatically load the new classes.
