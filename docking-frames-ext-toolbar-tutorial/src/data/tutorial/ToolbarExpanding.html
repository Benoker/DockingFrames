Sometimes a simple button is just not enough. The extension allows each toolbar to have three different sizes. Using
the ExpandableToolbarItemStrategy a toolbar can have a small and a medium sized button. It can also be converted into
a stack of large Components.

	<li>Clients need to set the property ExpandableToolbarItemStrategy.STRATEGY, an 
	instance of DefaultExpandableToolbarItemStrategy should be good enough for most clients.</li>
	<li>Clients need to use Dockables that implement ExpandableToolbarItem, for example
	the ComponentDockable.</li>
