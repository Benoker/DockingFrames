<html>Originally designed to be a test client, this application now shows how
Common handles the case were a layout is loaded for which not all Dockables 
are available.

The application contains 4 different views:
<ul>
<li><b>Testing Environment</b>: This view uses its own <i>CControl</i> and the other 
views can add or remove elements from this control. It represents the part
of an application that the user would see, while the other views represent
those parts which are normally hidden from the user.</li>
<li><b>Storage</b>: Allows to store and load the layout of 'Testing Environment' 
at any time. The layout can either be stored in 'xml' or in 'binary' format.</li>
<li><b>Single Dockables</b>: Can be used to add/remove <i>SingleCDockable</i>s or
<i>SingleCDockableBackupFactory</i>s to/from 'Testing Environment'.</li>
<li><b>Multiple Dockables</b>: Can be used to add <i>MultipleCDockable</i>s
to 'Testring Environment' or to add/remove <i>MultipleCDockableFactory</i>s.</li>
</ul>

You can use this application as follows:
<ol>
<li>Create a more or less sophisticated layout by adding various <i>SingleCDockable</i>s
and <i>MultipleCDockable</i>s to 'Testing Environment'.</li>
<li>Store the layout in 'Storage'.</li>
<li>Remove none, some or all <i>CDockable</i>s from 'Testing Environment'.</li>
<li>Load a layout from 'Storage'.</li>
<li>Add dockables or factories to 'Testing Environment' and observe how Common
tries to put the elements again at their old location.</li>
</ol>

There are some limitations of which you need to be aware:
<ul>
<li>Once you choose a format for the layout ('xml' or 'binary') you should
stick with that format. If some part of a layout cannot be read because a factory
is missing, then it remains in its raw format. It is not possible to convert
such a fragment into the other format.</li>
<li>Data about <i>SingleCDockable</i>s tends to stick around for a longer period
than data for <i>MultipleCDockable</i>s. But in any case: loading a layout with
a missing factory, and then storing the layout again can and will result in
a loss of data.</li>
<li>There are different degrees in how aggressive Common tries to put the elements
back at their old place. This application runs at the highest possible degree.
It is possible to disable the whole recovery system or to do some fine-tuning, 
i.e. only restore a subset of elements.</li>
</ul>
