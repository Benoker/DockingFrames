<html><body>Actions can be used to build some kind of toolbar. This example shows some of the most
often used actions. If you start the application you will see the actions on the top right of the
frame. From left to right the actions are:

<ul>
	<li>SimpleButtonAction: the equivalent of a JButton</li>
	<li>3 * SimpleSelectableAction.Radio: the equivalent of a JRadioButton</li>
	<li>SimpleMenuAction: the equivalent of a JPopupMenu</li>
	<li>SimpleDropDownAction: shows a set of other actions, copies the behavior of the last clicked action</li>
</ul>
