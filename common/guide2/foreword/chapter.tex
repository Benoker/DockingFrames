\section{Foreword}
After much delay version 1.0.8 is finally finished. Alright, not everything is as shiny as I wished it to be, but it works well enough. In my eyes 1.0.8 is an important milestone: for the first time the framework contains all the code necessary to handle ``real world'' applications:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Due to the new placeholder-mechanism, stored locations are now very stable and any layout can be recreated anytime.
 \item Due to the new \src{CLocationModeManager} \src{Common} is now much flexibler, the new real-fullscreen-maximization feature for free floating panels already makes use of this flexibility.
 \item Tabs are now put in a menu if there is not enough space to show them; and they can be shown on all sides.
 \item Applications can prevent a user from closing a Dockable, e.g. they could ask the user if he would like to save its data before closing the Dockable.
 \item And there are many more small improvements and bugfixes, have a look at the \src{changes.txt} document that comes alongside the framework.
\end{itemize}

Looking at the questions of our forum \footnote{\url{http://forum.byte-welt.de/forumdisplay.php?f=69&langid=2}} the framework is now feature complete. So the next version is 1.1.0, it will address the issues mentioned in chapter \ref{sec:suggestions} which could not be addressed in 1.0.8.\\
