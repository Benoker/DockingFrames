- Minimized, maximized and externalized elements with a CWorkingArea might get stored and recreated on layout change. That should not happen.
- [done] check whether multiple CContentAreas work properly or not
- [done] More constructors for DefaultCSingleDockable, DefaultCMultipleDockable.
- [done] Closing a maximized, stacked Dockable is counterintuitive
- [done] Opening a CDockable when another is maximized (and the two should be stacked) leads to layout failures
- [done] Way to track focus on CDockable
- [done] Give an option to handle locked resize like in VLDocking: see http://forum.byte-welt.net/showthread.php?p=4278#post4278
- [done] When opening a closed CDockable it can't be selected (tested with Paint)
(- Introduce concept of "DockGroup" a set of Dockables which should not be mixed)
(- Preference pages for colors and keystrokes?) 
- [done] Allow default locations for CDockables (for example allow to set, that a CDockable should be minimized to the left area)
