- Minimized, maximized and externalized elements with a CWorkingArea might get stored and recreated on layout change. That should not happen.
- [done ]check whether multiple CContentAreas work properly or not
- [done] More constructors for DefaultCSingleDockable, DefaultCMultipleDockable.
- Closing a maximized, stacked Dockable is counterintuitive
- [done] Way to track focus on CDockable
- Give an option to handle locked resize like in VLDocking: see http://forum.byte-welt.net/showthread.php?p=4278#post4278
