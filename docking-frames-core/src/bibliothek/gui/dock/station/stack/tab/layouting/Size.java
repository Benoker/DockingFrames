/**
 * A {@link Size} is used by a {@link LayoutBlock} to describe the layout
 * that fits to some size.<br>
 * There are two properties that describe how good a {@link Size} is. They are used in different cases:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>The {@link #getType() type} is a hard restraint, it is used to filter layouts. Layouts with an odd mix of 
 * preferred and minimum sizes are not legal and will never be applied. An example would: if the menu for overflowing
 * {@link Dockable}s has a mimimum size, the list of tabs must have a minimum size as well.</li>
 *  <li> The {@link #getScore()} is a soft restraint, it is used to order different layouts and to find the one layout
 *  that fits best. </li>
 * </ul>
