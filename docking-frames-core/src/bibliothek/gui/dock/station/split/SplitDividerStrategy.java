/**
 * The {@link SplitDividerStrategy} is responsible for resizing the children of a {@link SplitDockStation}. How exactly
 * a {@link SplitDividerStrategy} accomplishes that goal is not defined, but usually that involves:
 * <ul><li>Adding a {@link MouseListener} and a {@link MouseMotionListener} to the {@link Component} that is given during the
 * {@link #install(SplitDockStation, Component) installation}.</li>
 * <li>If the user presses the mouse the strategy will use {@link SplitDockStation#getRoot()} and {@link SplitNode#getDividerNode(int, int)} to find the {@link Node} that
 * is below the mouse.</li>
 * <li>By calling {@link Node#getDividerAt(int, int)} and {@link Node#setDivider(double)} the strategy can resize
 * the children.</li>
 * <li>Through {@link SplitDockStation#getCurrentSplitLayoutManager()} and {@link SplitLayoutManager#validateDivider(SplitDockStation, double, Node)} a strategy
 * can make sure that a valid value for the divider property is chosen.</li>
 * </ul>
 * A strategy may offer additional services like changing the {@link Cursor}, or a strategy
 * may not do anything at all.<br>
 * Implementations should (but are not enforced to) respect some properties:
 * <ul> 
 * 	<li>{@link SplitDockStation#isResizingEnabled()}: whether the user is allowed to resize the children.</li>
 * 	<li>{@link SplitDockStation#isContinousDisplay()}: whether resizing should happen immediatelly.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * Clients usually do not need to implement this interface, and the framework offers only one default
 * implementation. The interface will however remain, ready for clients with unforseen needs.
