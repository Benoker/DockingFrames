/**
 * A remote relocator can be used to perform a drag & drop operation of a
 * {@link Dockable} without the need to know more than the <code>Dockable</code>.<br>
 * The methods of this interface correspond to methods which are used in 
 * <code>MouseListener</code> and <code>MouseMotionListener</code>:
 * <table>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>{@link #init(int, int, int, int, int)}</td>
 *   <td>{@link MouseListener#mousePressed(MouseEvent)}</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>{@link #drag(int, int, int)}</td>
 *   <td>{@link MouseMotionListener#mouseDragged(MouseEvent)}</td>
 *  </tr>
 *  <tr>
 *   <td>{@link #drop(int, int, int)}</td>
 *   <td>{@link MouseListener#mouseReleased(MouseEvent)}</td>
 *  </tr>
 * </table><br>
 * The names of these three methods correspond to their normal reaction, when
 * only the left mouse button is pressed (or released). When other buttons
 * are pressed, then the behavior of this relocator may change heavily. The
 * relocator might even cancel a drag & drop operation.
 * <br><br>
 * The described three methods return a {@link Reaction}. A result that is 
 * {@link Reaction#CONTINUE CONTINUE} or 
 * {@link Reaction#CONTINUE_CONSUMED CONTINUE_CONSUMED} means, that 
 * the relocator is not yet finished with the operation. Further events have to
 * be sent to the relocator.<br>
 * If the result is {@link Reaction#BREAK BREAK} or 
 * {@link Reaction#BREAK_CONSUMED BREAK_CONSUMED}, then
 * the relocator has finished the operation.<br>
 * If the result is {@link Reaction#BREAK_CONSUMED BREAK_CONSUMED} or 
 * {@link Reaction#CONTINUE_CONSUMED CONTINUE_CONSUMED},
 * then the relocator has "used up" the event. If the client uses existing 
 * {@link MouseEvent MouseEvents} to call the methods, then {@link MouseEvent#consume()}
 * should be invoked.
 * <br><br>
 * The described three methods need the (simulated) location of the mouse
 * in relation to the screen (arguments <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>). The
 * methods need also information which buttons are currently pressed
 * (argument <code>modifiers</code>). Have a look at {@link InputEvent#getModifiersEx()}
 * to find out, how <code>modifiers</code> has to be encoded. 
 * <br><br>
 * Clients can safely assume, that the relocator is not interested in events
 * performed after the last button of the mouse is released.<br>
 * Clients might implement a {@link MouseListener} and a {@link MouseMotionListener}
 * which are both added to the same {@link Component}. The events received
 * by these listeners can be safely and unchecked forwarded to the relocator, 
 * as long as the <code>Component</code> represents only one {@link Dockable}.<br>
 * If the <code>Component</code> represents more than one <code>Dockable</code>,
 * then each event should be delivered only to one <code>RemoteRelocator</code>.
 * If that relocator is interested in the event, all other events have to be
 * forwarded to the same relocator, until the relocator is no longer interested
 * in the events. That includes events which would normally be sent to another
 * relocator.<br>
 * If two relocators are assigned to the same <code>Dockable</code>, then they
 * can substitute each other at any time.<br>
 * Mixing events with different sources or using different, not substitutable 
 * relocators while one relocator is interested in the events, will lead to 
 * unspecified behavior.<br>
 * A drag & drop operation can be canceled in any state by calling {@link #cancel()}.
 * Afterwards no events have to be sent to the relocator any more (it is not forbidden to
 * send more events).<br><br>
 * New <code>RemoveRelocators</code> can be delivered by 
 * {@link DockRelocator#createRemote(Dockable)}.
