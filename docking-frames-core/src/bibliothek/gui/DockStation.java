/**
 * A <code>DockStation</code> is some area (e.g. a {@link Component}) showing
 * a set of {@link Dockable}s called "children". The station is free to decide how and if to
 * show its children.<br>
 * Although a station can take any form, there are some (optional) practices to follow:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>Each {@link Dockable} should be child of a {@link DockableDisplayer}. The displayer will
 *  paint border and title of the item.</li>
 *  <li>This station should be aware of the current {@link DockTheme} and use its factories and delegates whenever possible.</li>
 *  <li>Drag and drop is handled by the {@link DockController}. Methods like {@link #canDrag(Dockable)}, {@link #drag(Dockable)}, 
 * {@link #prepareDrop(StationDropItem)} need to be implemented for this. Also {@link #accept(Dockable)}, {@link Dockable#accept(DockStation)},
 * {@link Dockable#accept(DockStation, Dockable)} and the {@link DockAcceptance} of the current {@link DockController} should be checked before
 * allowing a drag and drop operation.</li>
 *  <li>For each child there should be at least one {@link DockTitle}. This station needs to derive a {@link DockTitleVersion} from
 *  its controller using the {@link DockController#getDockTitleManager() DockTitleManager} and its 
 *  {@link DockTitleManager#registerDefault(String, DockTitleFactory) factory method}. With the {@link DockTitleVersion}-object one
 *  {@link DockTitleRequest} for each required {@link DockTitle} can be created.</li>
 *  <li>One child can be focused. If this station changes the focus it should use {@link DockController#setAtLeastFocusedDockable(Dockable, Component)}.</li>
 *  <li>This station should support placeholders. The current {@link PlaceholderStrategy} can be used to convert {@link Dockable}s to placeholders. 
 *  A {@link PlaceholderList} is a good datastructure to store {@link Dockable}s and placeholders at the same time.</li>
 *  <li>Additional points where the user can start drag and drop operations can be installed by implementing a {@link DockElementRepresentative}. It
 *  has to be installed using {@link DockController#addRepresentative(DockElementRepresentative)}. </li>
 *  <li>And a new {@link DockFactory} will be required to persistently store the layout of this station.</li>
 * </ul>
