\section{Extensions} \label{sec:extensions}
Extensions allow libraries to add new code to the framework, this code will be treated as if it were always part of the framework. Basically it is a plug-in mechanism. Currently there are not many points where an extension can be inserted, new extension-points will be added when needed.

\src{Extension}s are collected by the \src{ExtensionManager}. Any module can call \src{load} to load extensions that match some \src{ExtensionName}. 

\designbox{Extensions were introduced in 1.0.8 to allow the usage of the glass-components. The glass-components could not be added directly to the framework due to licencing issues.}
