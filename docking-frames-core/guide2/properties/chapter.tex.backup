\section{Properties}
There are a number of interesting settings whose effects are deeply hidden within the framework. Properties are an easy way to access these settings and change them. Properties are represented by the class \src{DockProperties} which can be accessed through \src{getProperties} of \src{DockController}.

\src{DockProperties} is nothing else than a map. Instances of \src{PropertyKey} are used as keys. The type of the value depends on the key and the map is typesafe. With the help of a \src{DockPropertyListener} any object can be informed immediately when a value changes.

There are a number of keys and the remainder of this chapter will list all of the keys that are present in version 1.1.1. If not explicitly said otherwise, then any change in the properties will have an immediate effect. This list is only an overview, please have a look at the API documentation or the source code to find out about types and default values.

\warningbox{Some of these properties are accessed and changed by \src{DockTheme}s. It is still possible to override these properties, but clients should be careful and ensure not to break the theme.}

\subsection{Miscellaneous}
Some properties that do not fit in any other category.
\begin{description}
 \property{DockController.RESTRICTED\_ENVIRONMENT}{Applets and webstart}{A Java application has limited rights when executed as applet or from webstart. The framework however needs some special rights, for example to monitor the position of the mouse. If these rights are not available, the framework activates some workarounds (which are not very efficient). In such cases the framework is called to \emph{be running in a restricted environment}. The property is set automatically, and usually clients need only read access. They can change the property, with the danger that the application no longer works afterwards.}
 \property{DockAction.BUTTON\_CONTENT\_FILTER}{Show text on buttons}{\src{DockAction}s can be shown on buttons. Usually the button contains only the icon of the action, but this strategy allows to show the text (usually used in menus) of the actions as well.}
 \property{DockActionImportanceOrder.ORDER}{Importance of actions}{Tells the order of importance of a set of \src{DockAction}s. In a situation where there is not enough space to show all actions, the least imporant actions will disappear first. Clients can also use the annotation \src{DockActionImportance} to mark the importance of actions.}
 \property{TabPane.LAYOUT\_MANAGER}{Layout of tabs}{This strategy is used by \src{TabPane} to decide where to show tabs, menus or info-component.}
 \property{SingleTabDecider.SINGLE\_TAB\_DECIDER}{Always show tabs}{Usually tabs only appear when some \src{Dockable}s are stacked. This strategy tells whether \src{Dockable}s that are not stacked should still feature a tab.}
 \property{CombinedMenuContent.MENU\_CONTENT}{Drop down menu on stacks}{If there is not enough space to show all tabs on a \src{StackDockStation}, a menu appears where the user can see the missing tabs. How exactly this menu looks like and how it is implemented is defined by this property.}
 \property{PlaceholderStrategy.PLACEHOLDER\_STRATEGY}{Keep track of \src{Dockable}s}{Tells the \emph{placeholder} of a \src{Dockable}. The placeholder is left behind if a \src{Dockable} is removed from a station, this way the framework still knows the old place of the item. Clients using \src{DockFrontend} or the Common project should not change this property.}
 \property{DisablingStrategy.STRATEGY}{Disable items}{This strategy tells which items (\src{Dockable}s, titles, tabs, actions) are disabled. Items that are disabled have a different color and do not react to user input.}
 \property{DockRelocatorMode.NO\_COMBINATION\_MASK}{No stacking during drag and drop}{If this \src{KeyStroke} is pressed during a drag and drop operation, the framework will not combine \src{Dockable}s. For example the framework will not create a new \src{StackDockStation}.}
 \property{DockRelocatorMode.SCREEN\_MASK}{Forced floating during drag and drop}{If this \src{KeyStroke} is pressed during a drag and drop operation, the only valid target of the operation is a \src{ScreenDockStation}.}
 \property{DockFrontend.HIDE\_ACCELERATOR}{Close \src{Dockable}s}{If this \src{KeyStroke} is hit, the currently focused \src{Dockable} is closed - assuming the \src{Dockable} can be closed in the first place.}
 \property{AWTComponentCaptureStrategy.STRATEGY}{Dealing with AWT components}{Allows clients to implement code to take images from AWT components. There are some default strategies available, going from ``nice'' to ``ugly workaround''.}
 \property{GlassedPane.TOOLTIP\_STRATEGY}{Tooltips in applets and on webstart}{In a restricted environment the framework will use an invisible \src{Component} to catch all \src{MouseEvent}s. This component is also responsible for showing tooltips. This strategy allows clients to modify the tooltip behavior: how they are created, and what they show.}
\end{description}

The Toolbar Extension provides some additional properties.
\begin{description}
 \property{ExpandableToolbarItemStrategy.STRATEGY}{Each toolbar-item can appear in three different sizes, this strategy tells which sizes are available for which items. Clients usually have no need to implement this interface, instead the \src{Dockable}s should implement \src{ExpandableToolbarItem}.}
 \property{ToolbarGroupDockStation.DIVIDER\_STRATEGY\_FACTORY}{\src{ToolbarGroupDockStation}: Painting between \src{Dockable}s.}{This strategy allows the \src{ToolbarGroupDockStation} to paint some borders between its children.}
